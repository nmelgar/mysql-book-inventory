# MySQL Book Inventory System

This project is a Book Management System developed to enhance my skills as a software engineer. The system is designed to manage a collection of books, allowing users to add, update, delete, and search for books in a SQL relational database. The software integrates with a MySQL database using the `mysql.connector` library in Python.

The purpose of this software is to provide a practical application of database management and Python programming, demonstrating how to interact with a relational database through a Python application.
